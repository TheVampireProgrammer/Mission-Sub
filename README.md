If you play this game, please run the file "rungame.sh" . If you do not want to run that file, enter 
these commands in the terminal:

sudo csc Main.cs
sudo chmod +x Main.exe
./Main.exe

Make a mod if you want. This game does not have a GNU liscence or anything but do not copy this game and 
do not say you made it. You are free to mod it, though. I would love to see your mod.

Have fun!
